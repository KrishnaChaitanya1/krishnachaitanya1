            <p>
                I&rsquo;m an undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering student &amp; an aspiring Data Scientist with an endless hunger to learn new things.
                I strive to deliver quality work through focused research and endeavour to be at the edge of emerging technology.

                    <h3 id="IBM"> Unsupervised Approached to Social Networks and Social Phenomenon</h3>

                    <p>
                        This is an ongoing final year project. The main aim of this project is to analyze the social network data and uncover the insights. The major problems faced were with collection of dataset. 
						Currently model generation is pending. <p>The final outcome would be to have a comparision between different unsupervised models and to present the uncovered insights.</p>

                    <p>
						This was my first full length data science project. Right from data collection to providing insights was done in a given time span.
						Once the data was collected, it was cleaned, analysed and insights are generated.
						<p>A blog post was written explaining the process and insights I uncovered from this data. The blog post link can be found <a href="https://medium.com/@kchaitanya556/food-cuisine-relation-between-toronto-canada-and-new-york-city-usa-1f5b2f635b1a">here.</a>

                    <p>I was part of a small team, responsible for generating visualizations for air pollution during the Diwali time in 2017 in Chennai . 
					   Worked on Spider Plots, Pie Charts &amp; Bar Charts for visualization. Published a paper on analyzing the trends in pollution, but it was rejected on review.</p>

                    <p>
                        This was done as part of IBM Data Analytics Sessions. I was asked to create a small project on data preprocessing and visualization concepts. Used the Pokemon data from Kaggle and gave a presentation on the
						findings.
